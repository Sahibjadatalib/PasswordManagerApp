        Password manager app is a offline app and we do not store your data on our server.
        \n\nAll your data is saved offline in your device.
        \n\nAs this app stores all your important data in your device only
        so once you forgot your master password there is no way to get your data back
        \n\nSet a strong but easy to remember password.
